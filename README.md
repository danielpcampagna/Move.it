<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://nlw4-moveit-two.vercel.app/)

This is not a project for commercial aims but serves to fill my personal portfolio of projects. This project was partially developed together with the Rockseat team during the fourth Next Level Week edition for educational aims. Further changes after release [v1.0.0](https://github.com/danielpcampagna/next-level-week-4/releases/tag/v1.0.0) were implemented on my own. These changes inter alias append the following functionalities: 

* Users can now Log In by using GitHub username; [in progress]
* Users can persist and share on Twiter their Ranking position; and [to-do]
* Users can use this app as a PWA. [to-do]

### Move.it

![Challenge completed](public/captured.gif)

Move.it is a web application to assist people who work seated throughout their journey. By using gamification principles where users can grow up their level while accumulate experience, Move.it randomly generates a challenge after 25min that requires the user to execute an ergometry exercise involving part of his or her body or eyes. If such a challenge is completed, the user gains experience. All these challenges were obtained from a safe source regarding the benefit of health.

Here is how to use the app in current version:
* When you get ready to start your journey, access the Move.it and click on the blue button "Start a cycle";
* When the countdown finishes, a new challenge will show for you on the left. If you execute it, then click on the button "complete"; otherwise, click on the button "fail";
* As more you complete the challenges, your experience bar grows up until you level up.

Of course: fair play!
